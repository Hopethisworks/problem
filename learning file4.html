                <div class="concept">
                    <p>
                    I've learned terminology like <em>tags</em> and <em>elements</em> (tag - content - tag) in HTML.  I have learned that there are different types of tags, some require <a href="http://www.google.com">attributes</a> and some impact the text by putting it in a "box" (the<em>"block"</em> elements.) The body of the web page is most important, and is the focus of this learning.  Complex information is in the header, and is important also. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I've learned that computers will follow these direction precisely, even if they are <b>incorrect</b> directions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I've learned that repetition wastes time and can introduce errors.

                <div class="concept">
                    <p>
                    CSS is a cascading style sheet, and is a way to define how you want your <em> class </em> to look.  It makes a lot more sense when you realize that <em> class </em> is a user-defined field, and you define the field in the style sheet. This significantly contributes to reduced repetition and also makes all of your similar elements look and behave the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In CSS, code comments begin with /* and end with */.

                <h2>HTML Box Sizing</h2>
                <div class="concept">
                <p>
                HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components (center out: content, padding, border, margin.) If you set sizing in % instead of pixels, it will re-size more properly on different size screens.  Also , it is important to set the box-sizing attribute to every element to this:<br>
                <span class="focus">* {<br>
        -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
        -moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
        -ms-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
        box-sizing: border-box;<br>
    } </span>

         <h2>Computer Science Basics</h2>
         <div class="concept">
         <p>
         Here are some terms to understand: <br>
         Python is a language we will use, and it is also a program that will interpret the language we write into something the computer can understand.  This is known as an <em>Interpreter.</em> Another program that will help write code is a <em>Compiler,</em> which will write new programs for you using its code, all at one time. 
         </p>
         <p>
         Python uses Grammar like Sentence = Subject Verb Object.  In this example, the Subject Verb and Object are <em>Non-Terminal</em> items.  Non-terminal means something you are not finished with, and you keep replacing with a replacement based on the defined rules until you get to a <em>Terminal. </em><br>
Rule example: Non-Terminal -> Replacement<br>
Terminals never appear on the left side of a rule.
         </p>
         <p>
         Python uses expressions as well.  The rules are similar, replace Expressions with a number, number operator (like + ) number, or another Expression:<br>
			Expression -> Expression Operator Expression <br>
			Expression -> Number <br>
			Actual numbers and operators are terminals on the right side of the rule <br>
         </p>
         </div>
         <h2>Variables</h2>
         <div class="concept">
         <p>
         Variables are a way to assign meaning to a number, like a description.  This is so you can then use the descriptive term for the number in the future to reduce confusion and make it easier to see how the number is being used logically.  For example:
         </p>
         <UL style="list-style-type:none">
         <li> Millionth = 1.0/1000000</li>
         <li> Now if you want to display a very large number in Millionths so it is more manageable, you can mutliply by "Millionth" instead of re-typing all the numbers.</li>
         </UL>
         You must be careful, however, because if the definition for the variable changes at some point, the new definition is used <em>until it is again re-defined.</em>  Here is a simple example of how this works:
         <UL style="list-style-type:none">
         <li> nickels = 20 #it is a good idea to add notes with a # in front to remind you what you defined - here I'm saying 4 quarters in a dollar#</li>
         <li> dollars_in_10 = 10 #there are 10 dollars in a ten dollar bill#</li>
         <li> nickels_in_10 = nickels * dollars_in_10 #not very meaningful, but you get the idea#</li>
         </UL>
         </div>
         <h2>Strings</h2>
         <div class="concept">
         <p>
         Strings are lines of text surrounded by one or two quotes.  You can use either to allow you to use the text version of the other kind of quotes within the string.  You can define a string with a variable name, just like the number example above, then use that variable name as shorthand. Once you have the string defined, you can work with text within the string with two commands: <em> INDEX</em> and <em> FIND</em>.
         </p>
         <UL style="list-style-type:none">
         <li>Index counts the characters in the string from left to right, beginning with ZERO. The syntax is to put the index you are looking for in brackets, and can return one character or a range of characters.  For a range  Examples:</li>
         </UL>
         <UL style="list-style-type:circle">
         <li> string [2] means "r" because you count the 3rd character from "s" </li>
         <li> string [1:3] means "tr" because you start at the 2nd character (remember, start at zero) and stop one character before your end point, that is, don't include your last character when counting a range.</li>
         <li>Don't forget that the expressions in the index counts can be variables themselves, and much more complex than simple numbers!</li>
         </UL>
         <p>
         Find is a function that finds a target string within the original string and returns the number of the character where the target begins. The syntax is string1.find(string2). There is another parameter you can add, so that the computer will begin looking for string2 at a particular character within string1, like string1.find(string2,4) will begin looking for string2 within string1 at character 4. This is helpful if you are looking for multiple instances of string2 within string1 since .find without the second parameter will only return the start of the first instance of string2.<br>
 Putting these two together is helpful - find the start of string2 then print the remainder of string1 from that point to confirm you found it. Like so:
 		 </p>
         <UL style="list-style-position:inside">
         <li>string1="Python is more fun than HTML"</li>
         <li>string2="more"</li>
         <li>print string1.find(string2) = 10  #I'm looking for the position where string 2 appears in string 1 </li>
         <li>print string1[10:] = more fun than HTML</li>
         <li>print string1[string1.find(string2):] = more fun than HTML #substiting string 2 in place of 10th position gives the same answer, useful for picking up text</li>
         </UL>
         Now, isn't that cool?? :)
         <br>
         </div>
         <h2>Procedures or Functions</h2>
         <div class="concept">
         <p>
         A function is something that takes is defined by the developer and then takes input, does something, and then produces output. For example, a function named <em>sum</em> could take a user-defined number of inputs and add them if they are digits or concatenate them if they are strings as output.  The developer names it <em>sum</em> so it makes sense, but it could be called anything since it is user defined. One first creates the function, then can use it many times over without having to re-define it. This is another example of eliminating repetition.  <br>
         A function is written with a "def" (define) then a label, followed by inputs in parantheses. Every instruction line after the definition of the name must be indented. The final line of the function MUST include a return staetement, what you want the function to return in the end, or it won't actually <em>do</em> anything. However, there are times when you don't <em>want</em>the code to do anything yet, so you end the procedure with the term <em>pass</em> rather than return.<br>
         
         Here is an example of <em>sum</em>:
         </p>
                   <div class="code-block">
            def sum(x,y,z): <br>
            <span class="indent">return x+y+z</span>
          		</div>
          <p>
          To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. Like this:
          <div class="code-block">
            print sum(4,5,6) <br>
            >>>15
          </div>
         </div>
         <h2>A Baby Python is born!</h2>

        <h2>The plot thickens - Operators </h2>
    <div class="concept">
        <p>
        Operators provide a means for comparision and returns a Boolean 'True' or 'False.' They include
        </p>
        <UL style="list-style-position:inside">
        <li> greater than, greater than or equal to </li> <!-- I want to type > and >= but I get code errors if I use those characters -->
        <li> less than, less than or equal to </li> <!-- I want to type  < and <= but I get code errors if I use those characters -->
        <li> != means not equivalent </li>
        <li> == means an equality comparison.  Must use double = because a single = is how we assign values to a variable </li>
        </UL>
        <p>
        Here is an example of a <em>test exression </em> using operators:
        </p>
         <div class="code-block">
            if (test epression): <br>
            <span class="indent">This block of instructions are executed ONLY if true and is indented</span><br>
            This block of instructions is executed if the test is false and is not indented
          		</div>
        <p>
        Here are some examples we used in class:
        </p>
                 <div class="code-block">
            def bigger (n,p): <br>
            <span class="indent"> If n>p:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> return n</span><br>
            <span class="indent"> Else:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> return p</span>
          		</div>
        <p>
        We used this 'bigger' function in a harder example that could be solved two ways:
        </p>
                 <div class="code-block">
            def biggest (a,b,c): <br>
            <span class="indent"> If a > b:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> If a > c:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_3"> return a</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> Else:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_3"> return c</span><br>
            <span class="indent"> Else:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> If b > c:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_3"> return b</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> Else:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_3"> return c</span><br>
          		</div><br>
         <p>
         Or it can be solved using the "bigger" function:
         </p>
       			<div class="code-block">
            def bigger (a,b): <br>
            <span class="indent"> If a>b:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> return a</span><br>
            <span class="indent"> Else:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent"> return b</span><br>
            def biggest (a,b,c): <br>
            <span class="indent"> return (bigger(bigger(a,b),c) </span><br>
            <em> OR </em><br>
            def biggest (a,b,c): <br>
            <span class="indent"> return max (a,b,c) </span>       
          		</div><br>
         <p>
         Example: Define a procedure, greatest, # that takes as input a list of positive numbers, and returns the greatest number in that list. If the input list is empty, the output should be 0.<br>
		</p>
             <div class="code-block">
			def greatest(list_of_numbers):<br>
            <span class="indent">     if list_of_numbers ==[]:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent">         return 0</span><br>
            <span class="indent">         else:</span><br>
            <span class="indent_indent">         return max(list_of_numbers)</span>
            </div><br>

         <p>
         Operators can also be used with text.  The example we covered was to return "True" if a person's name started with "D" or "N":
         </p>
               <div class="code-block">
         	def is_friend(name): <br>
   			<span class="indent">if name[0]=='D':</span><br>
        	<span class="indent_indent"> return True </span><br>
    		<span class="indent">if name[0]=='N': </span><br>
        	<span class="indent_indent">return True </span><br>
    		<span class="indent">return False </span><br>
            print is_friend('Diane') <br>
            returns : True
       			 </div><br><br>
         </div>
         <h2>Loops </h2>
    <div class="concept">
    	<p>
        Loops use a "While" function to repeatedly evaluate if the test expression is true and perform the block of code repeatedly as long as the expression is true.  A <em>Break</em> is used to stop the loop while the test expression is still true, and provides the ability to move to the next block of code.  The code stops running when the test expression is false, and moves to the next block of code.  Here is an example to count numbers from 1 to a defined number, including the defined number: 
        </p>
               <div class="code-block">      
        	def print_numbers(n): <br>
    		<span class="indent"> i = 1 </span><br>
    		<span class="indent"> while i is less than or equal to n: </span><br> <!--really says while i <= n: -->
        	<span class="indent_indent"> print i </span><br>
        	<span class="indent_indent"> i = i + 1 </span><br>
            print_numbers(3) <br>
            returns: <br>
            1<br>

    <h2>Structured Data</h2>
    <div class="concept">
    	<p>
        Structured data can be strings or lists.  A string is a sequence of characters, but the list is a sequence of ANYTHING.  You use INDEX features in lists, just like strings.  <br>
[] = an empty list<br>
<em> Here is a string and list comparison:</em>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th><b>Strings</b></th>
    <th><b>Lists</b></th>		
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>s = 'yabba!'</td>
    <td>p = ['y','a','b','b','a','!']</td>		
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>s[1]  returns 'a'</td>
    <td>p[1] returns 'a'</td>		
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>s[2:4] returns 'bb'</td>
    <td>p[2:4] returns ['b','b']</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
You can nest lists within lists.  If you need a line break to make it easier to read, break after the comma. For nested lists, you can index twice to return a single expression. Example:<br>
		<div class="code-block"> 
		List=[['you','Barry'],['me','Brenda']] <br>
		List[0][1] 
        </div><br>
        returns 'Barry'
	<h3>MUTATION:</h3>
    <p>
Lists support mutation (strings do NOT)- you can change the value of the list after it is created without creating a new object.  You assign a new value similar to index:
	</p>
		<div class="code-block">     
		List = ['Y','e','l','l','o']<br>
		List[0] = 'H' <br>
		Print List  
        </div><br>
		returns ['H','e','l','l','o']<br>
	<p>
Procedures do not need a return statement when replacing an item in a list
	</p>
	<h3>ALIASING:</h3>
Two different variables are assigned to the same object - this is important to understand when debugging - you may have renamed or added a name to a variable

	<h3>LIST OPERATIONS:</h3>
    <p>
Append - This is similar to the 'find' method and works like a procedure.  It mutates the list to add at the end of the list. It does NOT create a new list but edits the existing list.
	</p> 
		<div class="code-block"> 
		List.append('!') <br>
		Print List  
        </div><br>
        returns ['H','e','l','l','o','!']

	<h3>+ - : </h3>
    This works like concatenate for strings but DOES create a new list:<br>
		<div class="code-block">   
		a=[0,1] <br>
		b=[2,3]  <br>
		a + b  returns [0,1,2,3] <br>
		a.append(b) returns [0,1,[2,3]] 
</div><br>

	<h3>Len (short for length):</h3>
This counts the items in the list and returns a number. Len also works for strings and other items. <br>
		<div class="code-block"> 
		Len([0,1]) returns 2 <br>
		Len(['a',['b',['c','d']]]) returns 2 <br>
		Len('Udacity') returns 7
        </div><br>

	<h3>The += operator for lists:</h3>
This works by adding characters to the end of the list, similar to +, BUT also works like append in mutating the existing list.<br>
		<div class="code-block"> 
        list3 = [1,2,3,4] <br>
		list3 += [5,6,7] <br>
		print list3 <br>
		returns  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]<br>
        </div><br>


	<h3>Loops on Lists:</h3>
While Loop - continue to execute while the test is true <br>
For Loop - <em>e</em> is a new variable we introduce that is the first object in the list; <em>list</em> is any expression that returns a list. <em>e</em> is every element in the list, one by one.<br>
<!--examples are from From <https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud552-nd/l-3531748835/e-3618729701/m-3665548646> -->
		<div class="code-block"> 
        for <em>e</em> in <em>list</em>:<br>
		<span class="indent">		Block of code to perform on every element in list </span>
        </div><br>
        <p>	
Example:
		</p>
		<div class="code-block">
		def sum_list(p): <br>
		<span class="indent">	result = 0 </span><br>
		<span class="indent">	for e in p: </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">		result = result + e </span><br>
		<span class="indent">	return result</span><br><br>
		
		print sum_list( [4,5,6] ) 
		</div><br><br>
Returns 15
		<p>
Example: Define a procedure, measure_udacity, that takes as its input a list of strings, and returns a number that is a count of the number of elements in the input list that start with the uppercase letter 'U'.
		</p>
		<div class="code-block">
		def measure_udacity(p):<br>
		<span class="indent">	count = 0 </span><br>
		<span class="indent">	for e in p: </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">		If e[0]=="U" </span><br>
		<span class="indent_3">				count = count + 1 </span><br>
		<span class="indent">		return count </span><br>
        </div>
        <p>
Example: Define a procedure, find_element, that takes as its inputs a list and a value of any type, and returns the index of the first element in the input list that matches the value.   If there is no matching element, return -1. <br>
There are two solutions reviewed:
		</p>
		<div class="code-block">
		def find_element(list,target):<br>
		<span class="indent">		count = 0 </span><br>
		<span class="indent">		while count<em>is less than</em>len(list): <!--actual code is 'while count<len(list):' --> </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">	If list[count]==target: </span><br>
		<span class="indent_3">				return count </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">	count = count + 1 </span><br>
		<span class="indent">	return -1 </span><br>
        </div>
		<p>		
		OR
        </p>
		<div class="code-block">
        def find_element(list,target):<br>
		<span class="indent">		count = 0 </span><br>
		<span class="indent">		for e in list: </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">	If e == target: </span><br>
		<span class="indent_3">				return count </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">	count = count + 1 </span><br>
		<span class="indent">		return -1 </span><br>
        </div>
        <h3>INDEX and IN Procedures:</h3>
        <p>
An alternative solution is using INDEX method: - if <em>value</em> is in the <em>list</em> it returns the first position where <em>value</em> is found, otherwise produces an error<br>
Syntax <em>list</em>.index(<em>value</em>)<br><br>

Another operation required for the alternate is the IN procedure. <br>
Syntax is <em>value</em> in <em>list</em><br>
		</p>
		<div class="code-block">
		Print <em>value</em> in <em>list</em>
        </div> <br>
Returns False if the value is not in the list, else returns true because the value is in the list.  Can use the opposite and write <br>
		<div class="code-block">
		is <em>value</em> not in <em>list</em>
        </div> 
        <p>
        for opposite meaning.
        </p>
		<div class="code-block">
		def find_element(list,target): <br>
		<span class="indent">	If target in list: </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">	Return list.index(target) </span><br>
		<span class="indent">	else: </span><br>
		<span class="indent_indent">	Return -1 </span>
        </div><br><br>
		<div class="code-block">
		Print find_element([1,2,3],3)
        </div><br>
        <p>
Returns 2  because 3 is in character space 2 in the list starting at 0.
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
		Print find_element(['alpha','beta'],'gamma')
        </div><br>
        <p>
Returns -1 because gamma does not appear in the list. <br>
		<h3>More  Lists examples:</h3>

       <h2> Object Oriented Programming</h2>
       <div class="concept">
         <p> From Adobe: "Object-oriented programming is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build applications. Think of an object as a model of the concepts, processes, or things in the real world that are meaningful to your application. For example, in a project management application, you would have a status object, a cost object, and a client object among others. These objects would work together (and with many other objects) to provide the functionality that you want your project management application to have. Developers choose to program in the object-oriented paradigm because the proper use of objects makes it easier to build, maintain, and upgrade an application." In addition, it allows use of independently developed and tested modules that can be put together for a large project or used separately for a small one.  It allows the programmer to think about the objects that are the end goal, then develop code to support the object goals. This is opposite of procedureal programming, which thinks about the how process before the object of the process.  It works better for the beginner to conceptualize, I think. </p>
         <p>
         It is clear that python is using object-oriented programming as each module focuses on a single meaningful subject, then modules are put together.  HTML is also fundamentally object-oriented because you first define the "what" you are trying to build, determine the end goal, then figure out how to do it in meaningful boxes, or "objects."  Similar to the inheritance properties that instances of a class obtain from the parent in python, the CSS class is a singly developed style 'package' that can be used many times to provide the same properties to every instance of the class application in HTML. </p>

    <th><b>Description</b></th>		
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Object</td>
    <td>An object is a self-contained component that contains properties and methods needed to make a certain type of data useful. An object's properties are what it knows and its methods are what it can do. </td>		
  </tr>  
    <tr>
    <td>Class</td>
    <td>Neatly packaged 'box' that puts things together, like a blueprint of a building. The 'blueprint' contains enough generic information about the building that the same blueprint can be used to create many similar buildings.  Similarly, the class contains pieces of info about the class, so you can use it to create multiple objects from the class.  The objects created are instances.
</td>		
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Instantiation</td>
    <td>An instance is a specific object built from a specific class. It is assigned to a reference variable that is used to access all of the instance's properties and methods. When you make a new instance the process is called instantiation.  <br> Adobe has a great analogy: "Think about classes, instances, and instantiation like baking a cake. A class is like a recipe for chocolate cake. The recipe itself is not a cake. You can't eat the recipe (or at least wouldn't want to). If you correctly do what the recipe tells you to do (instantiate it) then you have an edible cake. That edible cake is an instance of the chocolate cake class."
</td>		
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>init</td>
    <td>A blank () is calling a function from the class called init (stands for initialize) that creates space in memory for a new object for the class. The init function inside the class is a <em>Constructor</em>, and when you create a class you must include the definition for init in reference to <em>self</em> (always the first parameter) to be able to construct new instances. Example: <br>
    <div class="code-block">class Student(object): <br>
    <span class="indent">'''3 single quotes document the class (or to document a module.)  When you type "doc" then Python will return the doc string.''' </span><br>

  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Python Standard Library</a> </td>
    <td>Python includes a standard library that provides built in modules that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. We learned about OS, Turtle, Time, and Webbrowswer standard modules.  I practiced Library on my own, and tried a few others but was not hugely successful.
</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>The from...import Statement</td>
    <td>Python's from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. The from...import has the following syntax:<br>
    <span class="indent">from modname import name1[, name2[, ... nameN]]</span><br>
	For example, to import the function <em>fibonacci</em> from the module <em>fib</em>, use the following statement:<br>
    <span class="indent">from fib import fibonacci</span><br>
	This statement does not import the entire module fib into the current namespace; it just introduces the item fibonacci from the module fib into the global symbol table of the importing module.<br> 			For our Twilio example: When I downloaded Twilio, it contained a folder (twilio) which contained another folder (rest) which contained a class (TwilioRestClient).<br>
When we say <em>rest.TwilioRestClient()</em> we are really calling the __init__ function defined in the class, and this creates an instance. We call this instance "Client" in the example how to use this class below.<br>

	This means from the twilio module, go to the rest folder and we are going to use the class TwilioRestClient from that folder and define the client attribute as such:<br>
	<div class="code-block">Client = TwilioRestClient(account_sid, auth_token)
    </div><br>
	OR you can say <br>
    <div class="code-block">
    From twilio import rest

	To tell the program to import the entire rest folder from the twilio module and define the client attribute as such: <br>
    <div class="code-block">
	Client = rest.TwilioRestClient(account_sid, auth_token)

    <td>Abstraction</td>
    <td>Steve Jobs explained it this way: "Objects are like people. They are living, breathing things that have knowledge inside them about how to do things and have memory inside them so they can remember things. And rather than interacting with them at a very low level, you interact with them at a very high level of abstraction, like we are doing right here.
Here's an example: If I'm your laundry object, you can give me your dirty clothes and send me a message that says, 'Can you get my clothes laundered, please?' I happen to know where the best laundry place in San Francisco is. And I speak English, and I have dollars in my pockets. So I go out and hail a taxicab and tell the driver to take me to this place in San Francisco. I go get your clothes laundered, I jump back in the cab, I get back here. I give you your clean clothes and you have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. Maybe you speak French, and you can't even hail a taxi. You can't pay for one, you don't have dollars in your pocket. Yet I knew how to do all of that. And you didn't have to know any of it. All that complexity was hidden inside of me, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction." </td>
